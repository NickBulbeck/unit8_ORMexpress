ORM sequelize with express
--------------------------

The app was set up using Express application generator - there's more info on that here:
https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html
... with some info on making a skeleton website here:

VERSION HELL
------------
The original version of sqlite fae package.json is "sqlite3": "^4.2.0". I tried updating
this to 5.0.0 to get it to run. This worked so far.
